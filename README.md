# Credit_Fraud_Detection-using-SOMs

## Overview
**Self Organising Maps (SOMs)** are very efficient way of analyzing huge dataset as it reduces the dimentionality of the dataset to 1 or 2 dimentions (at max) in order to make visualisation easier. These belong to Unsupervised Models. Since SOMs are not available in any library, **minisom.py** - a prebuilt code containing readlity usable _CLASS: Minisom_ is used to implement the SOM.



## Dataset 
The Dataset taken from **UCI machine learning repository called _"Statlog (Australian Credit Approval) Dataset".**_
It contains various credentials of 690 customers of a Bank. Last column contains whether the application given by that particular customers was approved (1) or not (0). We need to detect the fraudlent activity.

_NOTE: The credentials ofthe customers have been encoded.
